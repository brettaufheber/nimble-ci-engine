=== Additional Permission (User Data) — GPLv3 §7

This permission clarifies that *user-supplied runtime data* consumed or produced by the Program (e.g., configuration values, presets created by users) is treated as *user data*, not as a derivative work of the Program, and may be licensed under terms of the user's choice.

This permission does *not* apply to any files that are intended to be compiled, linked, or interpreted as part of the Program (for example: code modules, scripts executed in the Program’s address space, or templates that embed substantial Program code), nor to any files *distributed with this repository* (including examples, presets, and JSON Schema definitions).

=== Additional Permission (Linking for Extensions/Plugins) — GPLv3 §7

You may develop, use, link, and distribute independent modules (“Plugins” or “Extensions”) that communicate only via the Program’s published, stable plugin interfaces or inter-process mechanisms, and copy or distribute the resulting executable or object code (“Combined Work”) under terms of your choice, provided that *all* the following conditions are met:

1. The module is an independent work, does not incorporate substantial portions of the Program’s source code, and is not a modified version of this Program or a work based on the Program.
2. Distribution of the Program itself (and any modifications to it) remains under the GPL.
This permission does not grant additional rights to the Program’s *source code*.

For the avoidance of doubt, this permission applies only to the resulting executable/object code and does not alter any GPL obligations for the Program’s source.
Distribution of any Combined Work must not restrict recipients’ GPL rights with respect to the Program.

=== General Provisions (apply to this notice)

You may extend or remove these §7 permissions in your modified versions of the Program, but you are not obligated to do so.

No trademark or patent rights are granted by this notice.
If any clause of these permissions is held unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.
